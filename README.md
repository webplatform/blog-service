# WebPlatform Blog

Theme for [blog.webplatform.org](http://blog.webplatform.org/) for [WebPlatform](http://www.webplatform.org/).

## To install

**Note**: Althoug it seems to be a child theme of Twentyeleven, but in fact it is a copy of it.

* Have a basic WordPress installed and working
* Copy files in `wp-content/themes/webplatform/`
* Activate it in the WordPress admin panel
* Done!


## Please note

In a near future, all assets (CSS, JavaScript, images) that are specific for creating the image
of the WebPlatform site should be hosted/managed from within  
the [www.webplatform.org](https://github.com/webplatform/www.webplatform.org) project. Any other code
that is specific to wordpress can stay in this repository.
