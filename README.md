# WebPlatform Blog

Theme for [blog.webplatform.org](http://blog.webplatform.org/) for [WebPlatform](http://www.webplatform.org/).

## To install

**Note**: Althoug it seems to be a child theme of Twentyeleven, but in fact it is a copy of it.

* Have a basic WordPress installed and working
* Copy files in `wp-content/themes/webplatform/`
* Activate it in the WordPress admin panel
* Done!

## TODO

In a near future, all assets (CSS, JavaScript, images) would be called from 
the [www.webplatform.org](https://github.com/webplatform/www.webplatform.org) project.
